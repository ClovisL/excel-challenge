# Background
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. This file will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.
# Methods
Using an Excel table, I modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects to uncover some market trends.\

* Depending on whether a project succeeded, failed, or is still live, the cells in those columns are color coded.
* The percentage funded was also color coded based on how much was donated towards completion\

* A pivot table was created to filter and analyze different sections
* A stacked pivot chart was created to visualize the data
* A pivot chart line graph was created to visualize successful, failed, and cancelled projects over 12 months\

* A new sheet was created to analyze the percentage of successful, failed, and cancelled projects based on the amount of $ to reach their goal
* A line chart was made to graph the relationship between success rates and goal amount\

* Created a new worksheet to analyze the numebr of backers for successful and failed projects to see any difference in variation in how many backers a project had if it was successful or failed
